# Machine Learning Modeling
This machine learning team project is about - Mushroom Classification

---------------
**Objectives:** We are trying to fit the mushroom data with 7 different common machine learning models and trying to find out which model is the best to use to modeling such dataset

**Results:** Decision Tree Classifier model is the best model

--------------

**The project has seven parts:**
1. Dataset Features and Data Exploration
2. Visualization in correlation matrix
3. Train Test Split and Standard Scaling
   - Which is an prepreation step for later machine learning modeling
4. Fit the dataset with 7 common machine learning models and comparing between models
   - Logistic Regression
   - GaussianNB
   - K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier
   - Support Vector Classifier
5. Feature Importance and its visualization for the top 3 best performing models
6. PCA application in the 7 models
7. Fit the best model with the unseen dataset see how the model perform. Results:
   - 100% accuracy
   - Test score = 1
   - RMSE = 0
   - 0.0026 second running time
